SMA Backup Service is a worker service which is installed in windows services or linux Systemd to automate backups. SMA Backup Service is able to create backup and upload to online backup storages.

## Important
#### SMA Backup Service is currently under development and only supports SQL Server and MongoDb databases as backup source and FileSystem and Google drive as backup destination.

## SMABackup
